# Simple C compiler

## Purpose of the project
One day I decided to learn C. There were so many ways so I had to decide which path to choose. So here am I writing compiler for C... in C.

## Why am I sharing that code with the world
When I didn't knew where to start from I was looking for ready C compilers built with clear and simple code. No success for me :( I hope I can help someone to learn more about compilers or C. So, please, feel free to make that project better by sharing ideas, PRs or anything that would help beginners in this field like me.
